Overview
========

The goal of Empirical is to simplify the development of efficient, reliable, and accessible
scientific software.

We have several quick-start guides for different portions of the code.

Getting started:
- Using specific header files is simple, just :code:`#include` them into your own project.
We recommend adding your :code:`Empirical/source/` folder to the include directories for your C++ compiler (usually with the :code:`-I` option).
- To use the web features in Empirical, you must first install the emscripten compiler, which can be slightly more complicated.
* Our `Hello World Guide`_ will help you get compiling with Empirical, natively and for web.
