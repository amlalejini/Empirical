In this second version of MABE, we are trying to use simple base clases that can be
assembled at run time.

Also, renaming Organism into OrganismType since that better describes the classes role
(and we will have indiviudal organisms as well).

Example code:

  #include "mabe.h"
  #include "controlers/MarkovBrain.h"
  #include "genomes/LinearGenome.h"
  #include "genomes/NetworkGenome.h"
  #include "environments/FarmEnvironment.h"
  #include "schemas/TournamentSelect.h"
  #include "watchers/TrackLineage.h"

  int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    // Determine the types of everything that you want to use to build the world.
    mabe::OrganismType<mabe::MarkovBrain, mabe::LinearGenome> sheep("Sheep");
    mabe::OrganismType<mabe::MarkovBrain, mabe::NetworkGenome> wolves("Wolves");
    mabe::FarmEnvironment farm("FarmEnvironment");
    mabe::TrackLineage lineage_tracker("LineageTracker");
    mabe::TournamentSelect tourny_schema("TournamentSelect");

    // Build the world using these types.
    mabe::World world(sheep, wolves, farm, lineage_tracker, tourny_schema);

    // Configure the world using the "farm.cfg" file and command-line overrides.
    world.Config("farm.cfg", argv, argc);

    // Running world will go for full configured duration; can also manually Update() it.
    return world.Run();
  }
